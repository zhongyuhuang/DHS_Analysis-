# DHS Analysis

This repo uses the data collected from the Philippines National Demographic and Health Surveys in 1998 to investigate how background information could influence the percentage of teenage fertility.

The pdf of the final report of DHS - available here: https://dhsprogram.com/publications/publication-fr103-dhs-final-reports.cfm

That raw data is converted from the table on page 44 of the final report and is saved in inputs/data.
