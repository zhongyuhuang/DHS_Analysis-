abstract: "Teenage fertilities induce health risks and life impacts on both young mothers and their children. Philippines, one of the countries that have the highest adolescent birth rates, the teenage pregnancy toll is still rising here. This paper uses data collected by the National demographic and health survey in 1998 to investigate how background characteristics affect the teenage fertility rates in the Philippines. Evidence has shown that most teenage mothers received less education and lived in rural areas."

# Introduction

  According to the World Health Organization, an estimated 12 million girls aged 15â€“19 years give birth every year in developing countries. There are at least 777,000 girls aged under 15 years becoming pregnant yearly. Young individuals are expected to give birth after they successfully step into adulthood since early fertility leads to social and health-related impacts. It is not hard to imagine the difficulties that young mothers would face as they are economically dependent. Moreover, in current society, pregnant teenagers are disadvantaged. Research has shown that it is more likely for them to experience violence within partnerships. Other than that, early fertility contributes to health risks such as hypertension, low birth weight, and a high probability of spontaneous abortion. Thus, it is necessary and important to find ways to reduce teenage fertility.
  
  
  This paper uses data collected by the National Demographic and Health Survey to seek patterns in the background information of teenage mothers from the Philippines in 1998. Data related to fertility, child health, and family planning were reported in the DHS final report. We will use R[@citeR] to phase the Table 3.10 Teenage pregnancy and motherhood on page 45 of the pdf file to a useable data frame. By using appropriate graphs, we will analyze the relationships between teenage fertility and region, education level, and residence respectively.
  
  
  Results indicate that the percentage of women who are mothers increased greatly from 0.3 for the 15-years-old girls to 17 for those who were 19. Differences in residence, region, and education level lead to quite different rates. In the Philippines, rural regions of Western Mindanao, Eastern Visayas, and Cagayan Valley had the highest proportions of early fertility. The level of education had a significant effect on this rate as well. Individuals who received more education understand more of the impact caused by early fertility. Thus, we could conclude that providing more access to education would be an efficient way to reduce teenage fertility.
  
  
  The rest of the paper would be: Section "Data": introduce the survey and data. Section "Results": graphical presentation of results. Section "Discussions": discussions on what we find. Section "Weaknesses and next steps": talk about limitations involved in our analysis.



# Data

  Our data is collected by the Philippines National Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) in 1998. The DHS surveyed 13,983 women aged 15-49 nationwide by using questionnaires and interviews. It was designed to analyze potential trends in fertility, children's health, and family planning knowledge and use. We focus on the Teenage pregnancy and motherhood table on page 45 and phase it to a data frame from a pdf file.(Figure \@ref(fig:bills4)) The table summarized the percentage of teenage mothers with different background information from 2924 teenagers. Mainly with these four characteristics: Age, Residence, Region, and Education. More detailed information about the dataset can be find in the Appendix.

I created five variables: BG_inf stores the background information of teenagers, PT_Mom stores the percentage who are mothers, PT_Prg stores the percentage who are pregnant with their first child, PT_bear stores the percentage who have begun child-bearing, and NumOfTeen stores the total number of teenagers in that category. Non-surprisingly, the rate of teenage pregnancy increased linearly with age(Figure \@ref(fig:bills5)). The percentages of teenagers who are mothers or pregnant in the different backgrounds are linked in some ways. We see that regions had high rates are more likely less urbanized and with less access to education.

# Results


  Although teenage mothers only take up a small proportion of teenagers in the Philippines, we can see a significant difference between the backgrounds of these individuals. As for the residence type, proportions of rural teenage fertility are almost twice larger than those in urban residences(Figure \@ref(fig:bills)). Most of them had already begun child-bearing(10.8%). Individuals aged from 15 to 19 are supposed to attend at least high school. However, we find out that most of them received no education(34.6%) or only finished elementary school(31.8%)(Figure \@ref(fig:bills2)). We also observed a large increase in the proportion who are mothers from 3% among teens who attended college or higher to 17% among those with no education. By comparing teenage fertility by regions, we can see western Mindanao, ARMM, and the eastern Visayas are regions that share the highest proportions of teenage mothers(Figure \@ref(fig:bills2)). Consistent with the rural-urban differences, these three regions are less urbanized compared to others. Non-surprisingly, Metro Manila, the national capital region who are urbanized and with more access to education, corresponds to the lowest teenage fertility.
